#   Snakes and Ladders

A game where the player has to move up the board while praying that there are no snakes to bring them down. Maybe they'd be lucky and find a ladder on the way which makes their journey way easier, who knows?

This game was an excercise for Tehran University's Advanced Programming Course in the second semester.

The main purpose of this excercise was to learn more about Object Oriented Programming.

I'd say what I learned was how difficult keeping your code organized is and there will be many last minute bugs that will emerge when you least expect them. Especially when the program spirals into complexity. 

As a result of time shortage, I had to cut out a lot of functionality that would have stumped me for weeks. Mainly a 4 player functionality, and many other ambitious ideas.

I imagine I'll have to make these compromises all the time in software development to meet deadlines.

I was overall very satisfied with this mini two week project/assignment. I think it was suitably difficult enough, although I don not like the real snake and ladders game whatsoever. There's just too much left to chance in my opinion. Well, anyways...

with chance based game systems there is going to be unforseen bugs that won't be possible to account for, I hope the future reviewer, either be the Current Teacher's assistant of the course this assignment belongs to or any future github visitors would enlighten me as to how I messed up.

For now my job is done! Let's lie down on the floor contemplating my existential crisis.
